## Define Business Request

### Message from Sales Manager

I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our **internet sales reports** and want to move from static reports to **visual dashboards**.
Essentially, we want to focus on how much we have **sold of what products**, to **which clients** and how it has been **over time**.
Seeing as each **salesperson** works on different customers it would be beneficial to be able to **filter** them also.
We measure our numbers against **budget** so l added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.
The budget is for 2021 and we usually look **2 years back** in time when we do analysis of sales.
